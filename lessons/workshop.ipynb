If this was a real analysis, there are additional steps we would take to address this issue, but the point of this exercise is that everything we just did to validate our model was not suggested by Copilot when we asked it to identify the drivers of life expectancy. If we had just gone along with what Copilot gave us, we may not have discovered the problem with population size. **Not all incorrect code will result in an error or warning, the most common and insidious code problems are silent**, which is why it is essential to understand what your code is doing. We had to use our knowledge as data scientists to guide our analysis. Copilot is still helpful for creating code to run our models, generate plots, etc., but we need to be the ones in the driver's seat. You are the expert!\n",
